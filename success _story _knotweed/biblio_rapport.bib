  Abstract                 = {Recurrent mutations are a common phenomenon in population genetics. They may be at the origin of the fixation of a new genotype, if they give a phenotypic advantage to the carriers of the new mutation. In this paper, we are interested in the genetic signature left by a selective sweep induced by recurrent mutations at a given locus from an allele A {\$}A{\$} to an allele a {\$}a{\$} , depending on the mutation frequency. We distinguish three possible scales for the mutation probability per reproductive event, which entail distinct genetic signatures. Besides, we study the hydrodynamic limit of the A {\$}A{\$} - and a {\$}a{\$} -population size dynamics when mutations are frequent, and find non trivial equilibria leading to several possible patterns of polymorphism.},
